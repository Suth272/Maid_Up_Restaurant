# MAID UP RESTAURANT

Maid Up restuarant is up and coming restaurant that is gaining massive popularity, hence it has now resorted to online booking.

## NOTE
Unfortunately due to my circumstances I had limited time to create this booking system, so I was not able to fully complete the website or was I able to test, debug or fix the code of its issues.

## Repository
You can view the repository [here](https://github.com/Suth272/Maid_Up_Restaurant)

## Features
- Staff (those with access to the admin page) can add or remove tables and seats
- Users can successfully make reservations, which can be seen by the staff on the admin page.

## Future Features
- Make the website more aesthetically pleasing towards the user
- Add a menu page that the user can view to see what the restuarant serves
- Reservation validation - A system to check if reservation the user booked is available or not and alert the user of it.
- Limit the date input so users can't pick a past date.

## Manual Testing
I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
- [x] Incompleted the form, so that the website alerted the user that the form was incomplete.
- [x] Completed the form and checked in the admin page that the reservation was made successfully.
- [x] Used the admin page to add a multiple tables that had a range of seats available.
